#+TITLE: Yuzu Linux Downloader

Presently (Spring 2020) there is no linux installer for Yuzu. Unfortunately, the =earlyaccess= channel is only available via the installer. Meaning that in order to get an early access version of the emulator you first need to download the source onto a windows virtual machine, to be built on your linux machine.

This script removes the requirement of using the installer. It downloads the windows version directly from https://api.yuzu-emu.org/, patches it to be compatible with linux, and builds it in a user defined directory.

Note, in order to access the =earlyaccess= branch follow the instructions on https://yuzu-emu.org/help/early-access/

** Usage
For building EA, you may get your login token from https://profile.yuzu-emu.org
For many users, the simplest usage will be like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
wget https://github.com/RealJohnGalt/yuzu-linux-downloader/raw/master/yuzu-linux-downloader.sh
chmod +x ./yuzu-linux-downloader.sh
./yuzu-linux-downloader.sh
#+END_SRC

Full arguments:
#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
./yuzu-linux-downloader.sh [-c CHANNEL ] [-d DIRECTORY] [-g] [-o] [LOGIN_TOKEN]
#+END_SRC

Two additional flags exist that don't take arguments:
-g for an apitrace compatible build with debug symbols enabled.
-o to enable experimental optimizations that may cause regressions. NOT RECOMMENDED. If used, be sure to test without -o before reporting bugs upstream.

- Get your =LOGIN_TOKEN= from https://profile.yuzu-emu.org/

=CHANNEL= can be =earlyaccess= or =mainline=

=DIRECTORY= is where the yuzu program will be downloaded and compiled. It Defaults to pwd.

Once installed yuzu can be run via =./$DIRECTORY/$BUILDNAME/build/bin/yuzu=. =BUILDNAME= is dictated by https://api.yuzu-emu.org/

** Future Development
- Ask user if they want to download if the file already exists
- Modify to allow for easy automation (check for update every 24 hours and build)
